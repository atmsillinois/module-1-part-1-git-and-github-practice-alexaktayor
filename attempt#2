# Bullet two of Part 1 Module 1

## What I have learned
I am learning a lot about the github interface and how to interact with the platform. This is all very new to me, so it is taking some time to get a feel for.
Practice with bold: **Go Patriots!**

##What I am confused about
I just need a lot more practice and time to mess around in github. Nothing specific that I am currently confused about.
